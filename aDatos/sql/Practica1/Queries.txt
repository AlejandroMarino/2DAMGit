1. Get the orders of a given customer, showing the name of the customer and the
number of seats

    SELECT first_name,
           last_name,
           number_of_seats,
           orders.id,
           orders.table_id,
           orders.customer_id,
           orders.order_date,
           orders.total
    From orders
             INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
             INNER JOIN tables On orders.table_id = tables.id
    WHERE customers.id = ?;

2. Get the number of items of each order

    Select order_id, sum(order_items.quantity) as "number of items"
    from order_items
    group by order_items.order_id;

3. Get the name of the 2 oldest customers of the restaurant

    SELECT first_name, last_name
    from orders
             INNER JOIN customers on orders.customer_id = customers.id
    ORDER BY order_date
    LIMIT 2;

4. Get the name of the customer that has spent more money in the restaurant

    SELECT first_name, last_name, SUM(orders.total) AS total
    FROM orders
             INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
    GROUP BY orders.customer_id
    ORDER BY total DESC
    LIMIT 1;

5. Create two more queries for your classmates to practice

    a) Get the menu_items that have been ordered the most by each customer

        SELECT first_name, last_name, menu_items.name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
        FROM order_items
                 INNER JOIN menu_items ON order_items.menu_item_id = menu_items.id
                 INNER JOIN orders ON order_items.order_id = orders.id
                 INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
        GROUP BY customers.id, menu_items.name
        HAVING SUM(quantity) = (SELECT MAX(total_quantity)
                                FROM (SELECT customers.id As customer_id,
                                             SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
                                      FROM order_items
                                               INNER JOIN menu_items ON order_items.menu_item_id = menu_items.id
                                               INNER JOIN orders ON order_items.order_id = orders.id
                                               INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
                                      GROUP BY customers.id, menu_items.id) r
                                WHERE r.customer_id = customers.id);

    b) Get the customer that has ordered the most quantity of each menu_item

        SELECT menu_items.name, SUM(order_items.quantity) AS total_quantity, customers.first_name, customers.last_name
        FROM customers
                 JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
                 JOIN order_items ON orders.id = order_items.order_id
                 JOIN menu_items ON order_items.menu_item_id = menu_items.id
        WHERE order_items.quantity = (SELECT MAX(oi.quantity)
                                      FROM order_items oi
                                      WHERE oi.menu_item_id = order_items.menu_item_id)
        GROUP BY customers.id, menu_items.id;
