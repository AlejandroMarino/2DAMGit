        INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id = ?
        INNER JOIN tables On orders.table_id = tables.id;

2. Get the number of items of each order

    from order_items
    group by order_items.order_id;

3. Get the name of the 2 oldest customers of the restaurant

    SELECT first_name, last_name

        INNER JOIN order_items ON orders.id = order_items.order_id
        INNER JOIN menu_items ON order_items.menu_item_id = menu_items.id
